AI-Powered Text Processing Interface

Project Overview

The AI-Powered Text Processing Interface is a web application that utilizes Chrome's AI APIs to process user-inputted text. The application allows users to:

Detect the language of the input text.

Summarize text (if it exceeds 150 characters and is in English).

Translate text into multiple languages (English, Portuguese, Spanish, Russian, Turkish, French).

The UI is designed to resemble a chat interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Features

âœ… Input Display

A large, user-friendly textarea for users to enter text.

A send button with an icon-only display.

Sent messages appear immediately in the output area.

âœ… Language Detection

Uses the Language Detector API to identify the language of the entered text.

Displays the detected language below the output text.

âœ… Summarization (English Only)

If the text is more than 150 characters, a "Summarize" button appears.

Uses the Summarizer API to generate a summary.

The summarized text appears below the original text.

âœ… Translation

A dropdown allows users to select a language (English, Portuguese, Spanish, Russian, Turkish, French).

A "Translate" button triggers translation using the Translator API.

The translated text is displayed below the original message.

âœ… API Integration

Communicates with Chrome AI APIs asynchronously.

Handles API responses gracefully, ensuring a smooth user experience.

Displays error messages for failed API calls or invalid input.
